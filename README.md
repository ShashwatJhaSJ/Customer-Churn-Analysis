# Customer-Churn-Analysis

Hello!

Customer churn analysis is the process of analysing and assessing customer retention levels in order to identify opportunities for improvement,
whether that's improving retention of your most valuable users, coming up with ideas for how to attract and keep new users,
or informing changes to your products and services that encourage adoption and usage.

In this project I have used the Power BI platform to build an self-explanatory dashboard.

Thank You!
